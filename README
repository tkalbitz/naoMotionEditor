This is the custom Nao Motion Editor of the NaoTeam HTWK Leipzig [1]. It's
implemented in java and allows to code key frame transitions in groovy code 
fragments directly in the program.

The robot part is not yet open source, but with the provided source code could
be easy reverse engineered.

If you need any help contact me by mail. 

The icons are from the Tango Desktop Project [2].
